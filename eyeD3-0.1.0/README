General Information
===================

eyeD3 is a Python library for reading ID3v1/v1.1 tags from mp3 files.
Partial support for ID3v2 is complete.  It is entirely usable for reading
except for some advanced features such as extension headers, footers, padding,
and non UserText frames.  Future versions will strive for ID3v2.4 compliance.

Much of ID3v2Frame.py and all of binfuncs.py were written by Ryan Finnie
<ryan@finnie.org> for his PyID3 project. None of the PyID3 project
files have been touched since August 2001, and eyeD3 was essentially forked
from the 0.0.1 version.

The eyeD3 project pages is:

Requirements
============
 o Python >= 2.2 (for it's iterator support)

Optional
--------
 o id3lib.  If the id3lib (http://http://id3lib.sourceforge.net) library is
            found on your system it will be used to compile id3lib_test.
            This program is very used for obtaining valid ID3 data from files
            and is primarily used for *developing* eyeD3.  If id3lib is not
            found during configureation this program will not be built.
            
   
Installation
============

   gzip -dc eyeD3-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   cd eyeD3-x.y.z

   ./configure
   make
   make install (as root)

When Building From CVS
----------------------
In order to bootstrap the autoconf system, it is required to run ./autogen.sh.
The script only needs to be re-run when changes are made to configure.in or
acsite.m4.  autogen.sh is not included in distributions as it is not needed
unless working from a CVS repository.


How to Use eyeD3
================
The eyeD3.py utility is the best demonstration of eyeD3 usage.  So take a look
at it.  Some simle examples follow here, but in the interest of space no error
handling is shown.

Reading the contents of an mp3 file containing either v1 or v2 tag info:
   import eyeD3;
   tag = eyeD3.ID3_Tag();
   tag.link("/some/file.mp3");
   print tag.getArtist();
   print tag.getAlbum();
   print tag.getTitle();
   etc....

Or you can iterate of the raw frames:
   import eyeD3;
   tag = eyeD3.ID3_Tag();
   tag.link("/some/file.mp3");
   for frm in tag:
      print frm;
